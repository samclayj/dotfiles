PATH: <path>

Create a new directory formatted for you to take notes. This should be in path specified above. Start a notes.md file, and whatever else you need to start saving things I tell you to remember. 

If this directory is initialized for github, create a commit for this that we will submit and then your state will be saved across sessions when I have this directory up to date.

Also create a log.md where you log a high level of our interactions and anything interesting that would be useful for me to reference in the future if I'm looking back on the work we do together. Almost like a technical journal where useful code snippets and things are saved.
